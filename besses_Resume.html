                     <p>
                          To start off with I would like to be able to illustrate 
                          for the game and design video games that people will enjoy.
                          My plan for achieving this goal is by practicing 
                          coding,drawing and animation. This is my career 
                          choice because I like how games are designed,are made and how they look
